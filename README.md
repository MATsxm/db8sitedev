### Background
With my company [db8.nl](http://www.db8.nl) I support companies with Joomla websites.
When developing websites for customers I always have to do the same things to configure and optimize the website before putting it live.
The awesome **[Live Checklist](https://github.com/renekreijveld/livechecklist)** created by
**[Rene Kreijveld](http://www.renekreijveld.nl/)** has proven to be a great tool
to keep track of everything that you have to do. It's a list of things you have to do to configure and optimize your Joomla website.

However, it's a list that you can use offline next to your computer. But what if such a list would be inside the website you were developing?
I decided to develop this extension to have such a checklist tool within the website that is under development.
Webdevelopers can add their own checklist or Generate a default Live Checklist.

This extension consists of a Component and a Module:

#### Component
With the Admin Component a webdeveloper can easily create a checklist of all things that have to be done before the site can be put live.
The component has an option to import or export your own checklists.

#### Module
The Admin Module is published on the Control Panel of your /administrator back-end so that you can easily keep track of everything that still has to be done.
The UNchecked and Checked counters and Category name can all be clicked and will navigate you to the Checklist, filtered on what you clicked.
